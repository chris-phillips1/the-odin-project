# Current Project

The idea behind this project is to create a landing page website, with several distinct sections. Each section will have different elements and different styles applied to it.

# Skills Utilized

Upon completion on this project, I will have used my knowledge of a variety of HTML elements to display on the page. These elements might include using h1-h6, p, a, ul, li. I will also use a variety of css styles in order to accomplish the end goal.
